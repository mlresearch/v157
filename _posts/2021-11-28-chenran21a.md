abstract: Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is an important
  setting for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to communication
  constraints during execution and scalability constraints during training, which
  has shown superior performance but still suffers from challenges. One branch is
  to understand the mutual interplay between agents. Due to the communication constraints
  in practice, agents cannot exchange perceptual information, and thus, many approaches
  use a centralized attention network with scalability constraints. Contrary to these
  common approaches, we propose to learn to cooperate in a decentralized way by applying
  attention mechanism on the local observation so that each agent could focus on allied
  agents with a decentralized model, and therefore promote understanding. Another
  branch is to model how agents cooperate and simplify the learning process. Previous
  approaches that focus on value decomposition have achieved innovative results but
  still suffer from problems. These approaches either limit the representation expressiveness
  of their value function classes or relax the IGM consistency to achieve scalability,
  which may lead to poor performance. We combine value composition with game abstraction
  by modeling the relationships between agents as a bi-level graph. We propose a novel
  value decomposition network based on it through a bi-level attention network, which
  indicates the contribution of allied agents attacking enemies and the priority of
  attacking each enemy under the situation of each time step, respectively. We show
  that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on battle
  games in StarCraft â…¡, and attention analysis is also comprehensively discussed with
  sights.
