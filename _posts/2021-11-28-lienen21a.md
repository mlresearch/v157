title: Robust Regression for Monocular Depth Estimation
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Learning accurate models for monocular depth estimation requires precise
  depth annotation as e.g. gathered through LiDAR scanners. Because the data acquisition
  with sensors of this kind is costly and does not scale well in general, less advanced
  depth sources, such as time-of-flight cameras, are often used instead. However,
  these sensors provide less reliable signals, resulting in imprecise depth data for
  training regression models. As shown in idealized environments, the noise produced
  by commonly used RGB-D sensors violates standard statistical assumptions of regression
  methods, such as least squares estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether
  robust regression methods, which are more tolerant toward violations of statistical
  assumptions, can mitigate the effects of low-quality data. As a viable alternative
  to established approaches of that kind, we propose the use of so-called superset
  learning, where the original data is replaced by (less precise but more reliable)
  set-valued data. To evaluate and compare the methods, we provide an extensive empirical
  study on common benchmark data for monocular depth estimation. Our results clearly
  show the superiority of robust variants over conventional regression.
