title: Multi-Branch Network for Cross-Subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In recent years, electrocardiogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has received
  increasing attention in affective computing. Since the individual differences of
  EEG signals are large, most models are trained for specific subjects, and the generalization
  is poor when applied to new subjects. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Branch Network
  (MBN) model to solve this problem. According to the characteristics of the cross-subject
  data, different branch networks are designed to separate the background features
  and task features of the EEG signals for classification to have better model performance.
  Besides, there is no new-subject data needed during model training. In order to
  avoid the negative improvement caused by samples with significant differences to
  model training, a tiny amount of new-subject data is used to filter the training
  samples to improve the model performance further. Before training the model, the
  samples with significant differences from the new subject were deleted by comparing
  the background features between the subjects. The experimental results show that
  compared with Single-Branch Network (SBN) model, the accuracy of the MBN model is
  improved by 20.89% on the SEED dataset. Furthermore, compared with other common
  methods, the proposed method uses less new-subject data, which improves its practicability
  in practical application.
