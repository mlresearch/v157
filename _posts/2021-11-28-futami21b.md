title: Scalable gradient matching based on state space Gaussian Processes
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In many scientific fields, various phenomena are modeled by ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs). Parameters in ODEs are generally unknown and hard to measure directly.
  Since analytical solutions for ODEs can rarely be obtained, statistical methods
  are often used to infer parameters from experimental observations. Among many existing
  methods, Gaussian process-based gradient matching has been explored extensively.
  However, the existing method cannot be scaled to a massive dataset. Given $N$ data
  points, existing algorithms show $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ computational cost. In this
  paper, we propose a novel algorithm using the state space reformulation of Gaussian
  processes. More specifically, we reformulate Gaussian process gradient matching
  as a special state-space model problem, then approximate its posterior distribution
  by a novel Rao-Blackwellization filtering, which enjoys $\mathcal{O}(N)$ computational
  cost. Moreover, our algorithm is expressed as closed forms, it is 1000 times more
  faster than existing methods measured in wall clock time.
