title: On the Convex Combination of Determinantal Point Processes
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are attractive probabilistic models
  for expressing item quality and set diversity simultaneously. Although DPPs are
  widely-applicable to many subset selection tasks, there exist simple small-size
  probability distributions that any DPP cannot express. To overcome this drawback
  while keeping good properties of DPPs, in this paper we investigate the expressive
  power of \emph{convex combinations of DPPs}. We provide upper and lower bounds for
  the number of DPPs required for \emph{exactly} expressing any probability distribution.
  For the \emph{approximation} error, we give an upper bound on the Kullback–Leibler
  divergence $n-\lfloor \log t\rfloor +\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon >0$ of approximate
  distribution from a given joint probability distribution, where $t$ is the number
  of DPPs. Our numerical simulation on an online retail dataset empirically verifies
  that a convex combination of only two DPPs can outperform a nonsymmetric DPP in
  terms of the Kullback–Leibler divergence. By combining a polynomial number of DPPs,
  we can express probability distributions induced by bounded-degree pseudo-Boolean
  functions, which include weighted coverage functions of bounded occurrence.
