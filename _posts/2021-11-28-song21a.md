title: Hybrid Summarization with Semantic Weighting Reward and Latent Structure Detector
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Text summarization has been a significant challenge in the Nature Process
  Language (NLP) field. The approach of dealing with text summarization can be roughly
  divided into two main paradigms: extractive and abstractive manner. The former allows
  capturing the most representative snippets in a document while the latter generates
  a summary by understanding the latent meaning in a material with a language generation
  model. Recently, studies found that jointly employing the extractive and abstractive
  summarization models can take advantage of their complementary advantages, creating
  both concise and informative summaries. However, the reinforced summarization models
  mainly depend on the ROUGE-based reward, which only has the ability to quantify
  the extent of word-matching rather than semantic-matching between document and summary.
  Meanwhile, documents are usually collected with redundant or noisy information due
  to the existence of repeated or irrelevant information in real-world applications.
  Therefore, only depending on ROUGE-based reward to optimize the reinforced summarization
  models may lead to biased summary generation. In this paper, we propose a novel
  deep \bf{Hy}brid \bf{S}ummarization with semantic weighting \bf{R}eward and latent
  structure \bf{D}etector (HySRD). Specifically, HySRD introduces a new reward mechanism
  that simultaneously takes advantage of semantic and syntactic information among
  documents and summaries. To effectively model the accuracy semantics, a latent structure
  detector is designed to incorporate the high-level latent structures in the sentence
  representation for information selection. Extensive experiments have been conducted
  on two well-known benchmark datasets \emph{CNN/Daily Mail} (short input document)
  and \emph{BigPatent} (long input document). The automatic evaluation shows that
  our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of hybrid summarization
  models.'
