  in Single-shot EPI

crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Single-shot EPI(ssEPI) is one of the most important ultrafast MRI sequences
  commonly used for diffusion-weighted MRI and functional MRI. However, ssEPI suffers
  from susceptibility artifacts, especially in the high field or at the tissue boundaries.
  The widely used blip/down approaches, such as TOPUP, estimate the underlying distortion
  field from a pair of images with reversed-phase encoding direction. Typically, the
  iterative methods are used to find a solution to the ill-posed problem of finding
  the displacement map that maps up/down acquisitions onto each other. Then the geometric
  and intensity corrections are applied to obtain the undistorted images based on
  the estimated displacement map. This paper presents a new unsupervised cycle-consistent
  deep neural network that takes advantage of both the deep neural network and the
  gradient reversal method. The proposed method consists of three main components:
  (1) the Resnet50-Unet to map the pair of images with inverted phase encoding to
  the displacement maps; (2) the geometric and intensity correction module to obtain
  the undistorted images; (3) the forward model is applied to get the cycled blip
  up/down images, and the cycle-consistent loss is optimized. In addition, the CNN
  network will generate two field maps to overcome motion or field drift during the
  scan. This new network is trained unsupervised on the clinical datasets downloaded
  from the Human Connection Project website. And we test this method on both preclinical
  and clinical datasets. The preclinical dataset is collected from 20 mice based on
  the modified EPI pulse sequence in 7T scanner. Both simulated and experimental results
  demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion,
  we proposed an unsupervised cycle-consistent deep neural network for removing susceptibility
  artifacts. The results on both preclinical and clinical datasets show this new methodâ€™s
  acceleration and generalization capabilities.'
