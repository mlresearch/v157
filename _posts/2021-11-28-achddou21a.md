title: Fast Rate Learning in Stochastic First Price Bidding
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'First-price auctions have largely replaced traditional bidding approaches
  based on Vickrey auctions in programmatic advertising. %  As far as learning is
  concerned, first-price auctions are more challenging because the optimal bidding
  strategy does not only depend on the value of the item but also requires some knowledge
  of the other bids. % They have already given rise to several works in sequential
  learning, % many of which consider models for which the value of the buyer or the
  opponents’ maximal bid is chosen in an adversarial manner. Even in the simplest
  settings, this gives rise to algorithms whose pseudo-regret grows as $\sqrt{T}$
  with respect to the time horizon $T$. % Focusing on the case where the buyer plays
  against a stationary stochastic environment, we show how to achieve significantly
  lower pseudo-regret: when the opponents’ maximal bid distribution is known we provide
  an algorithm whose pseudo-regret can be as low as $\log^2(T)$; in the case where
  the distribution must be learnt sequentially, a generalization of this algorithm
  can achieve $T^{1/3+ \epsilon}$ pseudo-regret, for any $\epsilon>0$. % To obtain
  these results, we introduce two novel ideas that can be of interest in their own
  right. First, by transposing results obtained in the posted price setting, we provide
  conditions under which the first-price bidding utility is locally quadratic around
  its optimum. Second, we leverage the observation that, on small sub-intervals, the
  concentration of the variations of the empirical distribution function may be controlled
  more accurately than by using the classical Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality.
  % Numerical simulations confirm that our algorithms converge much faster than alternatives
  proposed in the literature for various bid distributions, including for bids collected
  on an actual programmatic advertising platform.'
