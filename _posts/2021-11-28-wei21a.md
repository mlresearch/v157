title: 'Sinusoidal Flow: A Fast Invertible Autoregressive Flow'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Normalising flows offer a flexible way of modelling continuous probability
  distributions. We consider expressiveness, fast inversion and exact Jacobian determinant
  as three desirable properties a normalising flow should possess. However, few flow
  models have been able to strike a good balance among all these properties. Realising
  that the integral of a convex sum of sinusoidal functions squared leads to a bijective
  residual transformation, we propose Sinusoidal Flow, a new type of normalising flows
  that inherits the expressive power and triangular Jacobian from fully autoregressive
  flows while guaranteed by Banach fixed-point theorem to remain fast invertible and
  thereby obviate the need for sequential inversion typically required in fully autoregressive
  flows. Experiments show that our Sinusoidal Flow is not only able to model complex
  distributions, but can also be reliably inverted to generate realistic-looking samples
  even with many layers of transformations stacked.
