title: Expert advice problem with noisy low rank loss
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: We consider the expert advice problem with a low rank but noisy loss sequence,
  where a loss vector $l_{t} \in [-1,1]^N$ in each round $t$ is of the form $l_{t}
  = U v_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$ for some fixed but unknown $N \times d$ matrix $U$ called
  the kernel, some $d$-dimensional seed vector $v_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, and some
  additional noisy term $\epsilon_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ whose norm is bounded by $\epsilon$.
  This is a generalization of the works of Hazan et al. and Barman et al., where the
  former only treats noiseless loss and the latter assumes that the kernel is known
  in advance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, where we re-construct the kernel
  under the assumptions, that the low rank loss is noised and there is no prior information
  about kernel. In this algorithm, we approximate the kernel by choosing a set of
  loss vectors with a high degree of independence from each other, and we give a regret
  bound of $O(d\sqrt{T}+d^{4/3}(N\epsilon)^{1/3}\sqrt{T})$. Moreover, even if in experiment,
  the proposed algorithm performs better than Hazanâ€™s algorithm and Hedge algorithm.
