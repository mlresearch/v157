title: Transfer Learning with Adaptive Online TrAdaBoost for Data Streams
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In many real-world applications, data are often produced in the form of
  streams. Consider, for example, data produced by sensors. In data streams there
  can be concept drift where the distribution of the data changes. When we deal with
  multiple streams from the same domain, concepts that have occurred in one stream
  may occur in another. Therefore, being able to reuse knowledge across multiple streams
  can help models recover from concept drifts more quickly. A major challenge is that
  these data streams may be only partially identical and a direct adoption would not
  suffice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to transfer both identical
  and partially identical concepts across different streams. In particular, we propose
  a new technique called Adaptive Online TrAdaBoost that tunes weight adjustments
  during boosting based on model performance. The experiments on synthetic data verify
  the desired properties of the proposed method, and the experiments on real-world
  data show the better performance of the method for data stream mining compared with
  its baselines.
