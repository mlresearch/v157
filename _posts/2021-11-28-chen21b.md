title: Multi-scale Salient Instance Segmentation based on Encoder-Decoder
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Salient instance segmentation refers to segmenting noticeable instance objects
  in images. In the face of multi-scale salient instances and overlapping instances,
  the existing salient instance segmentation methods have great limitations including
  inaccurate detection of large-scale instances, missing detection of small-scale
  instances, and wrong segmentation of overlapping instances. In order to solve these
  problems, a new multi-scale salient instance segmentation network (MSISNet) based
  on encoder-decoder is proposed. Firstly, a receptive field encoder (RFE) is designed
  to alleviate the problems of inaccurate detection of large-scale instances, missing
  detection of small-scale instances, and especially wrong segmentation of overlapping
  instances. Then, a pyramid decoder (PD) for the detection branch is designed to
  further alleviate the problem of inaccurate detection of large-scale instances and
  the difficulty in locating small-scale instances. Finally, a multi-stage decoder
  (MSD) is designed to improve the quality of the segmentation mask. Experiments on
  salient instance segmentation dataset Salient Instance Segmentation-1K (SIS-1K)
  have been conducted and the results show that the proposed method MSISNet is superior
  to the existing salient instance segmentation methods MSRNet and S4Net, and achieves
  better segmentation accuracy and speed.
