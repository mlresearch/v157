title: Augmenting Imbalanced Time-series Data via Adversarial Perturbation in Latent
  Space
section: Contributed Papers

abstract: Success of training deep learning models largely depends on the amount and
  quality of training data. Although numerous data augmentation techniques have already
  been pro- posed for certain domains such as computer vision where simple schemes
  such as rotation and flipping have been shown to be effective, other domains such
  as time-series data have a relatively smaller set of augmentation techniques readily
  available. Data imbalance is a phenomenon often observed in real-world data. However,
  a simple oversampling technique may make a model vulnerable to overfitting, so a
  proper data augmentation is desired. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel
  data augmentation method that utilizes the latent vectors of an autoencoder in a
  novel way. When input data are perturbed in its latent space, their reconstructed
  data retains properties similar to the original one. In con- trast, adversarial
  augmentation is a technique to train robust deep neural networks against unforeseen
  data shifts or corruptions by providing a downstream model with samples that are
  difficult to predict. Our method adversarially perturbs input data in its latent
  space so that the augmented data is diverse and conducive to reducing test error
  of a downstream model. The experimental results demonstrated that our method achieves
  the right balance, significantly modifying the input data to help generalization
  while retaining its realism.
