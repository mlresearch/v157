title: Domain Adaptive YOLO for One-Stage Cross-Domain Detection
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Domain shift is a major challenge for object detectors to generalize well
  to real world applications. Emerging techniques of domain adaptation for two-stage
  detectors help to tackle this problem. However, two-stage detectors are not the
  first choice for industrial applications due to its long time consumption. In this
  paper, a novel Domain Adaptive YOLO (DA-YOLO) is proposed to improve cross-domain
  performance for one-stage detectors. Image level features alignment is used to strictly
  match for  local features like texture, and loosely match for global features like
  illumination. Multi-scale instance level features alignment is presented to reduce
  instance domain shift effectively, such as variations in object appearance and viewpoint.
  A consensus regularization to these domain classifiers is employed to help the network
  generate domain-invariant detections. We evaluate our proposed method on popular
  datasets like Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K and et al.. The results demonstrate considerable
  improvement when tested under different cross-domain scenarios.
