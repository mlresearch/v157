abstract: Network structured data is ubiquitous in natural and social science applications.
  Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) has attracted significant attention recently
  due to its success in representing, modeling, and predicting large-scale network
  data. Various types of graph convolutional filters were proposed to process graph
  signals to boost the performance of graph-based semi-supervised learning. This paper
  introduces a novel spectral learning technique called EigLearn, which uses residual
  learning to perturb the eigenvalues of the graph filter matrix to optimize its capability.
  EigLearn is relatively easy to implement, and yet thorough experimental studies
  reveal that it is more effective and efficient than the prior works on the specific
  issue, such as LanczosNet and FisherGCN. EigLearn only perturbs a small number of
  eigenvalues and does not require a complete eigendecomposition. Our investigation
  shows that EigLearn reaches the maximal performance improvement by perturbing about
  30 to 40 eigenvalues, and the EigLearn-based GCN has comparable efficiency as the
  standard GCN. Furthermore, EigLearn bears a clear explanation in the spectral domain
  of the graph filter and shows aggregation effects in performance improvement when
  coupled with different graph filters. Hence, we anticipate that EigLearn may serve
  as a useful neural unit in various graph-involved neural net architectures.
