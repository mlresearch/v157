title: Temporal Relation based Attentive Prototype Network for Few-shot Action Recognition
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Few-shot action recognition aims at recognizing novel action classes with
  only a small number of labeled video samples. We propose a temporal relation based
  attentive prototype network (TRAPN) for few-shot action recognition. Concretely,
  we tackle this challenging task from three aspects. Firstly, we propose a spatio-temporal
  motion enhancement (STME) module to highlight object motions in videos. The STME
  module utilizes cues from content displacements in videos to enhance the features
  in the motion-related regions. Secondly, we learn the core common action transformations
  by our temporal relation (TR) module, which captures the temporal relations at short-term
  and long-term time scales. The learned temporal relations are encoded into descriptors
  to constitute sample-level features. The abstract action transformations are described
  by multiple groups of temporal relation descriptors. Thirdly, a vanilla prototype
  for the support class (e.g., the mean of the support class) cannot Ô¨Åt well for different
  query samples. We generate an attentive prototype constructed from temporal relation
  descriptors of support samples, which gives more weight to discriminative samples.
  We evaluate our TRAPN on Kinetics, UCF101 and HMDB51 real-world few-shot datasets.
  Results show that our network achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
