title: 'DPOQ: Dynamic Precision Onion Quantization'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'With the development of deployment platforms and application scenarios
  for deep neural networks, traditional fixed network architectures cannot meet the
  requirements. Meanwhile the dynamic network inference becomes a new research trend.
  Many slimmable and scalable networks have been proposed to satisfy different resource
  constraints (e.g., storage, latency and energy). And a single network may support
  versatile architectural configurations including: depth, width, kernel size, and
  resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture reuse strategy
  enabling dynamic precision in parameters. Since our low-precision networks are wrapped
  in the high-precision networks like an onion, we name it dynamic precision onion
  quantization (DPOQ). We train the network by using the joint loss with scaled gradients.
  To further improve the performance and make different precision network compatible
  with each other, we propose the precision shift batch normalization (PSBN). And
  we also propose a scalable input-specific inference mechanism based on this architecture
  and make the network more adaptable. Experiments on the CIFAR and ImageNet dataset
  have shown that our DPOQ achieves not only better flexibility but also higher accuracy
  than the individual quantization.'
