title: Penalty Method for Inversion-Free Deep Bilevel Optimization
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Solving a bilevel optimization problem is at the core of several machine
  learning problems such as hyperparameter tuning, data denoising, meta- and few-shot
  learning, and trainingdata poisoning. Different from simultaneous or multi-objective
  optimization, the steepest descent direction for minimizing the upper-level cost
  in a bilevel problem requires the inverse of the Hessian of the lower-level cost.
  In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for solving bilevel optimization problems
  based on the classical penalty function approach. Our method avoids computing the
  Hessian inverse and can handle constrained bilevel problems easily. We prove the
  convergence of the method under mild conditions and show that the exact hypergradient
  is obtained asymptotically. Our methodâ€™s simplicity and small space and time complexities
  enable us to effectively solve large-scale bilevel problems involving deep neural
  networks. We present results on data denoising, few-shot learning, and training-data
  poisoning problems in a large-scale setting. Our results show that our approach
  outperforms or is comparable to previously proposed methods based on automatic differentiation
  and approximate inversion in terms of accuracy, run-time, and convergence speed
