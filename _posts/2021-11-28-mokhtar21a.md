crossref: acml21
abstract: Urban planners and policy makers face the challenge of creating livable
  and enjoyable citiesfor larger populations in much denser urban conditions. While
  the urban microclimate holdsa key role in defining the quality of urban spaces today
  and in the future, the integrationof wind microclimate assessment in early urban
  design and planning processes remains achallenge  due  to  the  complexity  and  high  computational  expense  of  computational  fluiddynamics  (CFD)  simulations.   This  work  develops  a  data-driven  workflow  for  real-timepedestrian  wind  comfort  estimation  in  complex  urban  environments  which  may  enabledesigners,  policy  makers  and  city  residents  to  make  informed  decisions  about  mobility,health,
  and energy choices.  We use a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)architecture
  to reduce the computational computation while maintaining high confidencelevels
  and interpretability, adequate representation of urban complexity, and suitability
  forpedestrian  comfort  estimation.   We  demonstrate  high  quality  wind  field  approximationswhile
  reducing computation time from days to seconds.
