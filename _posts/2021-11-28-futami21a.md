title: Skew-symmetrically perturbed gradient flow for convex optimization
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Recently, many methods for optimization and sampling have been developed
  by designing continuous dynamics followed by discretization. The dynamics that have
  been used for optimization have their corresponding underlying functionals to be
  minimized. On the other hand, a wider class of dynamics have been studied for sampling,
  which is not necessarily limited to functional minimization. For example, dynamics
  perturbed with skew-symmetric matrices, which cannot be seen as minimization of
  functionals, have been widely used to reduce asymptotic variance. Following this
  success in sampling, exploring such perturbed dynamics in the context of optimization
  can open a new avenue to optimization algorithm design. In this work, we introduce
  a perturbation technique for sampling into optimization for strongly convex functions.
  We show that perturbation applied to the gradient flow yields rapid convergence
  in optimization for strongly convex functions. Based on this continuous dynamics,
  we propose an optimization algorithm for strongly convex functions with a novel
  discretization framework that combines the Euler method with the leapfrog method
  which is used in the Hamilton Monte Carlo method. Our numerical experiments show
  that the perturbation technique is useful for optimization.
