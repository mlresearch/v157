title: Collaborative Novelty Detection for Distributed Data by a Probabilistic Method
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Novelty detection, which detects anomalies based on a training dataset consisting
  of only the normal data, is an important task in several applications. In addition,
  in the real world, there may be situations where data is owned by multiple parties
  in a distributed manner but cannot be shared with each other due to privacy and
  confidentiality requirements. Therefore, how to develop distributed novelty detection
  while preserving privacy is essential. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic
  collaborative method that allows distributed novelty detection for multiple parties
  without sharing the original data. The proposed method constructs a collaborative
  kernel based on a collaborative data analysis framework, by which intermediate representations
  are generated from each party and shared for collaborative novelty detection. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better performance compared
  with the individual novelty detection in the local party.
