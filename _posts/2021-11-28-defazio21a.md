title: 'The Power of Factorial Powers: New Parameter settings for (Stochastic) Optimization'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: The convergence rates for convex and non-convex optimization methods depend
  on the choice of a host of constants, including step-sizes, Lyapunov function constants
  and momentum constants. In this work we propose the use of factorial powers as a
  flexible tool for defining constants that appear in convergence proofs. We list
  a number of remarkable properties that these sequences enjoy, and show how they
  can be applied to convergence proofs to simplify or improve the convergence rates
  of the momentum method, accelerated gradient and the stochastic variance reduced
  method (SVRG).
