title: Multi-view Latent Subspace Clustering based on both Global and Local Structure
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Most existing multi-view clustering methods focus on the global structure
  or local structure among samples, and few methods focus on the two structures at
  the same time. In this paper, we propose a Multi-view Latent subspace Clustering
  based on both Global and Local structure (MLCGL). In this method, a latent embedding
  representation is learned by exploring the complementary information from different
  views. In the latent space, not only the global reconstruction relationship but
  also the local geometric structure among the latent variables are discovered. In
  this way, a unified affinity graph matrix is constructed in the latent space for
  different views, which indicates a clear between-class relationship. Meanwhile,
  a rank constraint is introduced on the Laplacian graph to facilitate the division
  of samples into the required clusters. In MLCGL, the affinity graph also provides
  positive feedback to optimize the learned latent representation and contribute to
  divided it into reasonable clusters. Moreover, we present an alternating iterative
  optimization scheme to optimize objective functions. Compared with the state-of-art
  algorithms, MLCGL has achieved excellent experimental performance on several real-world
  datasets.
