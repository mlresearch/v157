abstract: 'Can a machine learn Machine Learning? This work trains a machine learning
  model to solve machine learning problems from a University undergraduate level course.
  We generate a new training set of questions and answers consisting of course exercises,
  homework, and quiz questions from MIT’s 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning course
  and train a machine learning model to answer these questions. Our system demonstrates
  an overall accuracy of 96% for open-response questions and 97% for multiple-choice
  questions, compared with MIT students’ average of 93%, achieving grade A performance
  in the course, all in real-time. Questions cover all 12 topics taught in the course,
  excluding coding questions or questions with images. Topics include: (i) basic machine
  learning principles; (ii) perceptrons; (iii) feature extraction and selection; (iv)
  logistic regression; (v) regression; (vi) neural networks; (vii) advanced neural
  networks; (viii) convolutional neural networks; (ix) recurrent neural networks;
  (x) state machines and MDPs; (xi) reinforcement learning; and (xii) decision trees.
  Our system uses Transformer models within an encoder-decoder architecture with graph
  and tree representations. An important aspect of our approach is a data-augmentation
  scheme for generating new example problems. We also train a machine learning model
  to generate problem hints. Thus, our system automatically generates new questions
  across topics, answers both open-response questions and multiple-choice questions,
  classifies problems, and generates problem hints, pushing the envelope of AI for
  STEM education.'
