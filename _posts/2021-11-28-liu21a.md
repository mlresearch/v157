title: An Aligned Subgraph Kernel Based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In this paper, a novel graph kernel is designed by aligning the amplitude
  representation of the vertices. Firstly, the amplitude representation of a vertex
  is calculated based on the discrete-time quantum walk. Then a matching-based graph
  kernel is constructed through identifying the correspondence between the vertices
  of two graphs. The newly proposed kernel can be regarded as a kind of aligned subgraph
  kernel that incorporates the explicit local information of substructures. Thus,
  it can address the disadvantage arising in the classical R-convolution kernel that
  the relative locations of substructures between the graphs are ignored. Experiments
  on several standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel has better performance
  compared with other state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of classification accuracy.
