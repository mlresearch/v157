title: Improving Hashing Algorithms for Similarity Search \textitvia MLE and the Control
  Variates Trick
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Hashing algorithms are continually used for large-scale learning and similarity
  search, with computationally cheap and better algorithms being proposed every year.
  In this paper we focus on hashing algorithms which involve estimating a distance
  measure $d(\vec{x}_i,\vec{x}_j)$ between two vectors $\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}_j$. Such
  hashing algorithms require generation of random variables, and we propose two approaches
  to reduce the variance of our hashed estimates: control variates and maximum likelihood
  estimates. We explain how these approaches can be immediately applied to a wide
  subset of hashing algorithms. Further, we evaluate the impact of these methods on
  various datasets. We finally run empirical simulations to verify our results.'
