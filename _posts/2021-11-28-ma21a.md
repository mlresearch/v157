title: 'PFedAtt: Attention-based Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous
  Clients'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In federated learning, heterogeneity among the clients’ local datasets results
  in large variations in the number of local updates performed by each client in a
  communication round. Simply aggregating such local models into a global model will
  confine the capacity of the system, that is, the single global model will be restricted
  from delivering good performance on each client’s task. This paper provides a general
  framework to analyze the convergence of personalized federated learning algorithms.
  It subsumes previously proposed methods and provides a principled understanding
  of the computational guarantees. Using insights from this analysis, we propose PFedAtt,
  a personalized federated learning method that incorporates attention-based grouping
  to facilitate similar clients’ collaborations. Theoretically, we provide the convergence
  guarantee for the algorithm, and empirical experiments corroborate the competitive
  performance of PFedAtt on heterogeneous clients.
