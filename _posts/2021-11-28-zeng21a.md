title: Iterative Deep Model Compression and Acceleration in the Frequency Domain
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully applied in many
  complex tasks, but their storage and huge computational costs hinder their deployment
  on edge devices. CNN model compression techniques have been widely studied in the
  past five years, most of which are conducted in the spatial domain. Inspired by
  the sparsity and low-rank properties of weight matrices in the frequency domain,
  we propose a novel frequency pruning framework for model compression and acceleration
  while maintaining high-performance. We firstly apply Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
  on convolutional kernels and train them in the frequency domain to get sparse representations.
  Then we propose an iterative model compression method to decompose the frequency
  matrices with a sampled-based low-rank approximation algorithm, and then fine-tune
  and recompose the low-rank matrices gradually until a predefined compression ratio
  is reached. We further demonstrate that model inference can be conducted with the
  decomposed frequency matrices, where model parameters and inference cost can be
  significantly reduced. Extensive experiments using well-known CNN models based on
  three open datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts
  in reduction of both the number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs)
  without sacrificing too much model accuracy.
