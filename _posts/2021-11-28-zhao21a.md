abstract: While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns
  and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))
  unfortunately limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as an
  alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints.
  The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative
  Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in industry, i.e., continuous
  and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN
  architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous
  and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long tail issues,
  i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values.
  To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss, classification loss
  and generator loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional
  vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of
  data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that
  generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The
  results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles
  the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy
  for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17%.
