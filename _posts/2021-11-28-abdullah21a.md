title: 'Beyond $L_p$ Clipping: Equalization based Psychoacoustic Attacks against ASRs'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems convert speech into text and
  can be placed into two broad categories: traditional and fully end-to-end. Both
  types have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial audio examples that sound
  benign to the human ear but force the ASR to produce malicious transcriptions. Of
  these attacks, only the “psychoacoustic” attacks can create examples with relatively
  imperceptible perturbations, as they leverage the knowledge of the human auditory
  system. Unfortunately, existing psychoacoustic attacks can only be applied against
  traditional models, and are obsolete against the newer, fully end-to-end ASRs. In
  this paper, we propose an equalization-based psychoacoustic attack that can exploit
  both traditional and fully end-to-end ASRs. We successfully demonstrate our attack
  against real-world ASRs that include DeepSpeech and Wav2Letter. Moreover, we employ
  a user study to verify that our method creates low audible distortion. Specifically,
  80 of the 100 participants voted in favor of \textit{all} our attack audio samples
  as less noisier than the existing state-of-the-art attack. Through this, we demonstrate
  both types of existing ASR pipelines can be exploited with minimum degradation to
  attack audio quality.'
