title: Expressive Neural Voice Cloning
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Voice cloning is the task of learning to synthesize the voice of an unseen
  speaker from a few samples. While current voice cloning methods achieve promising
  results in Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for a new voice, these approaches lack
  the ability to control the expressiveness of synthesized audio. In this work, we
  propose a controllable voice cloning method that allows fine-grained control over
  various style aspects of the synthesized speech for an unseen speaker. We achieve
  this by explicitly conditioning the speech synthesis model on a speaker encoding,
  pitch contour and latent style tokens during training. Through both quantitative
  and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework can be used for various
  expressive voice cloning tasks using only a few transcribed or untranscribed speech
  samples for a new speaker. These cloning tasks include style transfer from a reference
  speech, synthesizing speech directly from text, and fine-grained style control by
  manipulating the style conditioning variables during inference.
