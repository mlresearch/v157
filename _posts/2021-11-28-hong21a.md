title: Multi-stream based marked point process
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: When using a point process, a specific form of the model needs to be designed
  for intensity function, based on physical and mathematical prior knowledge about
  the data. Recently, a fully trainable deep learning-based approach has been developed
  for temporal point processes. This approach models a cumulative hazard function
  (CHF), which is capable of systematic computation of adaptive intensity function
  in a data-driven manner. However, this approach does not take the attribute information
  of events into account although many applications of point processes generate with
  a variety of marked information such as location, magnitude, and depth of seismic
  activity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully trainable marked point
  process method, modeling decomposed CHFs for time and mark using multi-stream deep
  neural networks. In addition, we also propose to encode multiple marked information
  into a single image and extract necessary information adaptively without detailed
  knowledge about the data. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method through
  experiments with simulated toy data and real seismic data.
