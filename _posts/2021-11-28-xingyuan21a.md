abstract: 'In the field of 3D object recognition, monocular 3D recognition technology
  is a valuable recognition technology. Compared with binocular technology and lidar
  technology, its cost is lower. In this paper, based on the existing monocular 3D
  recognition network, we propose an asymmetrical segmentation depth-aware network:
  ASD-Conv Network, which is used to better obtain the depth information of monocular
  images, so as to obtain better recognition results. Compared with other monocular
  recognition networks, ASD-Conv network performs special segmentation on the image,
  which can better obtain the depth distribution of the image, and has made a good
  breakthrough and improvement in the image recognition tasks of 2D, BEV and 3D. The
  improved algorithm proposed in this paper can improve the detection accuracy while
  maintaining a certain real-time performance. Experimental results show that compared
  with the current model, the proposed monocular 3D object detection algorithm based
  on D-ASDConv has an average improvement rate of 2.82%(AP) in large object detection
  and the highest average improvement rate of 2.01%(AP) in small object detection
  on Kitti dataset. The algorithm can effectively learn more advanced features of
  spatial perception, and the detection results of monocular images are more accurate.'
