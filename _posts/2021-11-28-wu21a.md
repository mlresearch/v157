title: Hybrid Estimation for Open-Ended Questions with Early-Age Students’ Block-Based
  Programming Answers
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Block-based programming is of great significance for cultivating children’s
  computational thinking. However, due to the following challenges, it is difficult
  to evaluate students’ programming ability in online learning systems: 1) compared
  with the traditional Online Judge (OJ) system, there is no standard answer for a
  given task in block-based programming; 2) in order to promote students’ interests,
  although the programs are not totally correct and unrelated to the task, the teacher
  will give a comparatively higher score. Therefore, current approaches involving
  output comparison and code analysis do not work effectively. Furthermore, deep learning
  methods also suffer from the problem of how to represent block code for classification.
  We propose a novel hybrid estimation model to address these challenges. We first
  learn graph embedding from the parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to present the
  logicality of the code. Next, we provide some methods to measure the workload and
  complexity of the code. Then, we extracted some key variables and task-irrelevant
  properties, introduced teacher bias. Finally, XGBoost was constructed for classification.
  Based on real-world data collected from an online Scratch platform by early-age
  students, our model outperforms KimCNN, ResNet-18, and Graph2Vec+XGBoost. Moreover,
  we provided statistical analyses and intuitive explanations to interpret the characteristics
  in various groups.'
