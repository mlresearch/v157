title: Asymptotically Exact and Fast Gaussian Copula Models for Imputation of Mixed
  Data Types
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Missing values with mixed data types is a common problem in a large number
  of machine learning applications such as processing of surveys and in different
  medical applications. Recently, Gaussian copula models have been suggested as a
  means of performing imputation of missing values using a probabilistic framework.
  While the present Gaussian copula models have shown to yield state of the art performance,
  they have two limitations: they are based on an approximation that is fast but may
  be imprecise and they do not support unordered multinomial variables. We address
  the first limitation using direct and arbitrarily precise approximations both for
  model estimation and imputation by using randomized quasi-Monte Carlo procedures.
  The method we provide has lower errors for the estimated model parameters and the
  imputed values, compared to previously proposed methods. We also extend the previous
  Gaussian copula models to include unordered multinomial variables in addition to
  the present support of ordinal, binary, and continuous variables.'
