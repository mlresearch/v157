title: Spatial Temporal Enhanced Contrastive and Pretext Learning for Skeleton-based
  Action Representation
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: In this paper, we focus on unsupervised representation learning for skeleton-based
  action recognition. The critical issue of this task is extracting discriminative
  spatial-temporal information from skeleton sequences to form action representation.
  To better solve this, we propose a novel unsupervised framework named contrastive-pretext
  spatial-temporal network (CP-STN), aiming to achieve accurate action recognition
  by better exploiting discriminative spatial-temporal enhanced features from massive
  unlabeled data. We combine contrastive and pretext tasks learning paradigms in one
  framework by using asymmetric spatial and temporal augmentations to enable network
  extracting discriminative representations with spatial-temporal information fully.
  Furthermore, graph-based convolution is used as the backbone to explore natural
  spatial-temporal graph information in skeleton data. Extensive experimental results
  show that our CP-STN signiÔ¨Åcantly boosts the performance of existing skeleton-based
  action representations learning networks and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
  on two challenging benchmarks in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.
