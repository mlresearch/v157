title: A Partial Label Metric Learning Algorithm for Class Imbalanced Data
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: The performance of machine learning algorithms depends on the distance metric,
  in addition to the model and loss function, etc. The partial label metric learning
  technique can improve the accuracy of partial label learning algorithms by using
  training data to learn a better distance metric, which has gradually attracted the
  attention of scholars in recent years. The essence of partial label learning is
  mainly to deal with multi-class classification problems, while class imbalance is
  a common phenomenon in these problems. The class imbalanced problem affects the
  prediction accuracy of minority class samples, but the current partial label metric
  learning algorithms rarely consider the problem. In this paper, we propose two partial
  label metric learning algorithms (PL-CCML-SFN and PL-CCML-LDD) that can solve the
  class imbalanced problem. The basic idea is to add a regularization term to the
  objective function of the PL-CCML model, which can induce each class to be uniformly
  distributed in the new metric space and thus play the role of balancing each class.
  The experimental results show that these two algorithms, compared with the existing
  partial label metric learning algorithms, have improved the overall performance
  on the class imbalanced data.
