title: Learn to Predict Vertical Track Irregularity with Extremely Imbalanced Data
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Railway systems require regular manual maintenance, a large part of which
  is dedicated to inspecting track deformation. Such deformation might severely impact
  trains’ runtime security, whereas such inspections remain costly for both finance
  and human resources. Therefore, a more precise and efficient approach to detect
  railway track deformation is in urgent need. In this paper, we showcase an application
  framework for predicting vertical track irregularity, based on a real-world, large-scale
  dataset produced by several operating railways in China. We have conducted extensive
  experiments on various machine learning & ensemble learning algorithms in an effort
  to maximize the model’s capability in capturing any irregularity. We also proposed
  a novel approach for handling imbalanced data in multivariate time series prediction
  tasks with adaptive data sampling and penalized loss. Such an approach has proven
  to reduce models’ sensitivity to the imbalanced target domain, thus improving its
  performance in predicting rare extreme values.
