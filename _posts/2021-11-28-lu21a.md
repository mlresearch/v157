abstract: 'Modern text data is increasingly gathered in situations where it is paired
  with a  high-dimensional collection of covariates:  then both the text, the covariates,
  and their relationships are of interest to analyze. Despite the growing amount of
  such data, current topic models are unable to take into account large amounts of
  covariates successfully:  they fail to model structure among covariates and distort
  findings of both text and covariates. This paper presents a solution: a novel factor-topic
  model that enables researchers to analyze latent structure in both text and sophisticated
  document-level covariates collectively. The key innovation is that besides learning
  the underlying topical structure,  the model also learns the underlying factorial
  structure from the covariates and the interactions between the two structures.  A
  set of tailored variational inference algorithms for efficient computation are provided.  Experiments
  on three different datasets show the model outperforms comparable topic models in
  the ability to predict held-out document content.  Two case studies focusing on
  Finnish parliamentary election candidates and game players on Steam demonstrate
  the model discovers semantically meaningful topics, factors, and their interactions.  The
  model both outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and offers
  new factor-topic insights beyond other topic models.'
