title: Learning 3-opt heuristics for traveling salesman problem via deep reinforcement

section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization
  problem. As it represents a large number of important practical problems, it has
  received extensive studies and a great variety of algorithms have been proposed
  to solve it, including exact and heuristic algorithms. The success of heuristic
  algorithms relies heavily on the design of powerful heuristic rules, and most of
  the existing heuristic rules were manually designed by experienced experts to model
  their insights and observations on TSP instances and solutions. Recent studies have
  shown an alternative promising design strategy that directly learns heuristic rules
  from TSP instances without any manual interference. Here, we report an iterative
  improvement approach (called Neural-3-OPT) that solves TSP through automatically
  learning effective 3-opt heuristics via deep reinforcement learning. In the proposed
  approach, we adopt a pointer network to select 3 links from the current tour,and
  a feature-wise linear modulation network to select an appropriate way to reconnect
  the segments after removing the selected 3 links. We demonstrate that our approach
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on both real TSP instances and randomly-generated
  instances than, to the best of our knowledge, the existing neural network-based
  approaches.
