title: Open Images V5 Text Annotation and Yet Another Mask Text Spotter
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'A large scale human-labeled dataset plays an important role in creating
  high quality deep learning models. In this paper we present text annotation for
  Open Images V5 dataset. To our knowledge it is the largest among publicly available
  manually created text annotations. Having this annotation we trained a simple Mask-RCNN-based
  network, referred as Yet Another Mask Text Spotter (YAMTS), which achieves competitive
  performance or even outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in some cases
  on ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015 and {Total-Text} datasets. Code for text spotting model
  available online at: \url{https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/training_extensions}.
  The model can be exported to OpenVINO{\texttrademark}-format and run on Intel{\textregistered}
  CPUs.'
