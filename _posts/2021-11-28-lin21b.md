title: Dynamic Popularity-Aware Contrastive Learning for Recommendation
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'With the development of deep learning techniques, contrastive representation
  learning has been increasingly employed in large-scale recommender systems. For
  instance, deep user-item matching models can be trained by contrasting positive
  and negative examples and learning discriminative user and item representations.
  Despite their success, the distinguishable properties of the recommender system
  are often ignored in existing modelling. Standard methods approximate maximum likelihood
  estimation on user behavior data in a manner similar to language models. Specifically,
  the way of model optimization corresponds to approximating the user-item pointwise
  mutual information, which can be regarded as eliminating the influence of global
  item popularity on user behavior to capture intrinsic user preference. In addition,
  unlike the situation in language models where word frequency is relatively stable,
  item popularity is constantly evolving. To address these issues, we propose a novel
  dynamic popularity-aware (DPA) contrastive learning method for recommendation, which
  consists of two key components: i) a dynamic negative sampling strategy is involved
  to enhance the user representation, ii) a dynamic prediction recovery is adopted
  by the real-time item popularity. The proposed strategy can be naturally overlaid
  on any contrastive learning-based matching model to more accurately capture user
  interest and system dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy
  is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on an e-commerce scenario of Alibaba
  Group.'
