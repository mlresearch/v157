title: 'ExNN-SMOTE: Extended Natural Neighbors Based SMOTE to Deal with Imbalanced
  Data'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Many practical applications suffer from the problem of imbalanced classification.
  The minority class has poor classification performance; on the other hand, its misclassification
  cost is high. One reason for classification difficulty is the intrinsic complicated
  distribution characteristics (CDCs) in imbalanced data itself. Classical oversampling
  method SMOTE generates synthetic minority class examples between neighbors, which
  is parameter dependent. Furthermore, due to blindness of neighbor selection, SMOTE
  suffers from overgeneralization in the minority class. To solve such problems, we
  propose an oversampling method, called extended natural neighbors based SMOTE (ExNN-SMOTE).
  In ExNN-SMOTE, neighbors are determined adaptively by capturing data distribution
  characteristics. Extensive experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of ExNN-SMOTE dealing with CDCs and the superiority of ExNN-SMOTE
  over other SMOTE-related methods.
