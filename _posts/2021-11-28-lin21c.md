title: Speaker Diarization as a Fully Online Bandit Learning Problem in MiniVox
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: We propose a novel machine learning framework to conduct real-time multi-speaker
  diarization and recognition without prior registration and pretraining in a fully
  online learning setting. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new
  benchmark to evaluate the rarely studied fully online speaker diarization problem.
  We build upon existing datasets of real world utterances to automatically curate
  MiniVox, an experimental environment which generates infinite configurations of
  continuous multi-speaker speech stream. Second, we consider the practical problem
  of online learning with episodically revealed rewards and introduce a solution based
  on semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods. Additionally, we provide
  a workable web-based recognition system which interactively handles the cold start
  problem of new userâ€™s addition by transferring representations of old arms to new
  ones with an extendable contextual bandit. We demonstrate that our proposed method
  obtains robust performance in the online MiniVox framework given either cepstrum-based
  representations or deep neural network embeddings.
