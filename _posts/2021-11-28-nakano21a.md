title: Bayesian nonparametric model for arbitrary cubic partitioning
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a continuous-time Markov process for cubic partitioning
  models of three-dimensional (3D) arrays and its application to Bayesian nonparametric
  relational data analysis of 3D array data. Relational data analysis is a topic that
  has been actively studied in the field of Bayesian nonparametrics, and in particular,
  models for analyzing 3D arrays have attracted much attention in recent years. In
  particular, the cubic partitioning model is very popular due to its practical usefulness,
  and various models such as the infinite relational model and the Mondrian process
  have been proposed. However, these conventional models have the disadvantage that
  they are limited to a certain class of cubic partitions, and there is a need for
  a model that can represent a broader class of arbitrary cubic partitions, which
  has long been an open issue in this field. In this study, we propose a stochastic
  process that can represent arbitrary cubic partitions of 3D arrays as a continuous-time
  Markov process. Furthermore, by combining it with the Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg representation
  theorem, we construct an infinitely exchangeable 3D relational model and apply it
  to real data to show its application to relational data analysis. Experiments show
  that the proposed model improves the prediction performance by expanding the class
  of representable cubic partitioning. '
