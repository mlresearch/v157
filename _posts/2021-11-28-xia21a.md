title: Fairness constraint of Fuzzy C-means Clustering improves clustering fairness
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is a classic clustering algorithm, which
  is widely used in the real world. Despite the distinct advantages of FCM algorithm,
  whether the usage of fairness constraint in the FCM could improve clustering fairness
  remains fully elusive. By introducing a novel fair loss term into the objective
  function, a Fair Fuzzy C-Means (FFCM) algorithm was proposed in this current study.
  We proved that the membership value was constrained by distance and fairness in
  the meantime during the optimization process in the proposed objective function.
  By studying the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering with fairness constraint problem and proposing
  a fair fuzzy C-means method, this study provided mechanism understanding in achieving
  the fairness constraint in Fuzzy C-Means clustering and bridged up the gap of fair
  fuzzy clustering.
