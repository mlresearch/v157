title: Bridging Code-Text Representation Gap using Explanation
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'This paper studies Code-Text Representation (CTR) learning, aiming to learn
  general-purpose representations that support downstream code/text applications such
  as code search, finding code matching textual queries. However, state-of-the-arts
  do not focus on matching the gap between code/text modalities. In this paper, we
  complement this gap by providing an intermediate representation, and view it as  “explanation.”
  Our contribution is three fold: First, we propose four types of explanation utilization
  methods for CTR, and compare their effectiveness. Second, we show that using explanation
  as the model input is desirable. Third, we confirm that even automatically generated
  explanation can lead to a drastic performance gain. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first work to define and categorize code explanation, for enhancing
  code understanding/representation.'
