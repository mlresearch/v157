title: Maximization of Monotone $k$-Submodular Functions with Bounded Curvature and
  Non-$k$-Submodular Functions
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: The concept of $k$-submodularity is an extension of submodularity, of which
  maximization has various applications, such as influence maximization and sensor
  placement. In such situations, to model complicated real problems, we want to deal
  with multiple factors, such as, more detailed parameter representing a property
  of a given function or a constraint which should be imposed for a given function,
  simultaneously. Besides, it is preferable that an algorithm for the modeling problem
  is simple. In this paper, for both monotone $k$-submodular function maximization
  with bounded curvature and monotone weakly $k$-submodular function maximization,
  we give approximation ratio analysis on greedy-type algorithms on the problem with
  the matroid constraint and that with the individual size constraint. Furthermore,
  we give an approximation ratio analysis on another type of the relaxation of $k$-submodular
  functions, approximately $k$-submodular functions, with the matroid constraint.
