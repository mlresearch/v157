title: Feature Convolutional Networks
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Convolutional neural networks are among the most successful deep learning
  models used for image processing, computer vision and natural language processing
  applications. In this paper, we define convolution operator for numerical tabular
  features and thus propose feature convolutional network model for machine learning
  tasks. Feature convolutional networks contain feature convolution layer to extract
  pairwise feature convolutions in the relational feature spaces. Compared with the
  baseline multi-layer neural network model, the feature convolutional network gains
  better performance among all the experiments. The experiments results suggest that
  feature convolutional networks can generate efficient features automatically and
  provide better performance through automatic feature learning. The demo code is
  at https://github.com/info-ruc/FeatConvNet.
