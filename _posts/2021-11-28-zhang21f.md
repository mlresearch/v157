title: Semi-Open Attribute Extraction from Chinese Functional Description Text
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Attribute extraction is a task to identify the attribute and the corresponding
  attribute value from unstructured text, which is important for extensive applications
  like web information retrieval and the recommended system. The traditional relation
  extraction-based methods or joint extraction-based systems are often perform attribute
  classify based on subject and attribute-value pairs, and extract the attribute triples
  in the scope of ontology schema categories, which is in the assumption of the close-world
  and cannot satisfy the diversity of attributes. In this work, we propose a semi-open
  information extraction system for attribute extraction in a multi-component framework.
  With the proposed semi-open attribute extraction system (SOAE), more attribute-value
  pairs can be discovered by extracting literal triples without the limitation of
  pre-defined ontology. An additional co-trained ontology-based attribute extraction
  model is appended as a component following the assumption of the partial-closed
  world (PCWA), remission the performance degradation of SOAE caused by missing of
  the literal predicate in raw text and contribute to extract richer attribute triples
  and construct more dense knowledge graph. For evaluating the performance of the
  attribute extraction system, we construct a Chinese functional description text
  dataset CNShipNet and conduct experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate
  that our proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines with a
  large margin.
