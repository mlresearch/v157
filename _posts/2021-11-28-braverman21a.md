title: Efficient Coreset Constructions via Sensitivity Sampling
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'A coreset for a set of points is a small subset of weighted points that
  approximately preserves important properties of the original set. Specifically,
  if $P$ is a set of points, $Q$ is a set of queries, and $f:P\times Q\to\mathbb{R}$
  is a cost function, then a set $S\subseteq P$ with weights $w:P\to[0,\infty)$ is
  an $\epsilon$-coreset for some parameter $\epsilon>0$ if $\sum_{s\in S}w(s)f(s,q)$
  is a $(1+\epsilon)$ multiplicative approximation to $\sum_{p\in P}f(p,q)$ for all
  $q\in Q$. Coresets are used to solve fundamental problems in machine learning under
  various big data models of computation. Many of the suggested coresets in the recent
  decade used, or could have used a general framework for constructing coresets whose
  size depends quadratically on the total sensitivity $t$. In this paper we improve
  this bound from $O(t^2)$ to $O(t\log t)$. Thus our results imply more space efficient
  solutions to a number of problems, including projective clustering, $k$-line clustering,
  and subspace approximation. The main technical result is a generic reduction to
  the sample complexity of learning a class of functions with bounded VC dimension.
  We show that obtaining an $(\nu,\alpha)$-sample for this class of functions with
  appropriate parameters $\nu$ and $\alpha$ suffices to achieve space efficient $\epsilon$-coresets.
  Our result implies more efficient coreset constructions for a number of interesting
  problems in machine learning; we show applications to $k$-median/$k$-means, $k$-line
  clustering, $j$-subspace approximation, and the integer $(j,k)$-projective clustering
  problem. '
