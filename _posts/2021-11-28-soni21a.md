title: Metric Learning for comparison of HMMs using Graph Neural Networks
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) belong to the class of double embedded stochastic
  models which were originally leveraged for speech recognition and synthesis. HMMs
  subsequently became a generic sequence model across multiple domains like NLP, bio-informatics
  and thermodynamics to name a few. Literature has several heuristic metrics to compare
  two HMMs by factoring in their structure and emission probability distributions
  in HMM nodes. However, typical structure-based metrics overlook the similarity between
  HMMs having different structures yet similar behavior and typical behavior-based
  metrics rely on the representativeness of the reference sequence used for assessing
  the similarity in behavior. Further, little exploration has taken place in leveraging
  the recent advancements in deep graph neural networks for learning effective representations
  for HMMs. In this paper, we propose two novel deep neural network based approaches
  to learn embeddings for HMMs and evaluate the validity of the embeddings based on
  subsequent clustering and classification tasks. Our proposed approaches use a Graph
  variational Autoencoder and diffpooling based Graph neural network (GNN) to learn
  embeddings for HMMs. The graph autoencoder infers latent low-dimensional flat embeddings
  for HMMs in a task-agnostic manner; whereas the diffpooling based graph neural network
  learns class-label aware embeddings by inferring and aggregating a hierarchical
  set of clusters and sub-clusters of graph nodes. Empirical results reveal that the
  HMM embeddings learnt through the Graph variational autoencoders and diffpooling
  based GNN outperform the popular heuristics as measured by the cluster quality metrics
  and the classification accuracy in downstream tasks.
