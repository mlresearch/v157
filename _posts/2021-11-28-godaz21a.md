title: Vector Transport Free Riemannian LBFGS for Optimization on Symmetric Positive
  Definite Matrix Manifolds
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: This work concentrates on optimization on Riemannian manifolds. The Limited-memory
  Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm is a commonly used quasi-Newton
  method for numerical optimization in Euclidean spaces. Riemannian LBFGS (RLBFGS)
  is an extension of this method to Riemannian manifolds. RLBFGS involves computationally
  expensive vector transports as well as unfolding recursions using adjoint vector
  transports. In this article, we propose two mappings in the tangent space using
  the inverse second root and Cholesky decomposition. These mappings make both vector
  transport and adjoint vector transport identity and therefore isometric. Identity
  vector transport makes RLBFGS less computationally expensive and its isometry is
  also very useful in convergence analysis of RLBFGS. Moreover, under the proposed
  mappings, the Riemannian metric reduces to Euclidean inner product, which is much
  less computationally expensive. We focus on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
  manifolds which are beneficial in various fields such as data science and statistics.
  This work opens a research opportunity for extension of the proposed mappings to
  other well-known manifolds.
