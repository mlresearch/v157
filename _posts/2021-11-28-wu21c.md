title: Lifelong Learning with Branching Experts
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'The problem of branching experts is an extension of the experts problem
  where the set of experts may grow over time. We compare this problem in different
  learning settings along several axes: adversarial versus stochastic losses; a fixed
  versus a growing set of experts (branching experts); and single-task versus lifelong
  learning with expert advice. First, for the branching experts problem, we achieve
  tight regret bounds in both adversarial and stochastic setting with a single algorithm.
  While it was known that the adversarial branching experts problem is strictly harder
  than the non-branching one, the stochastic branching experts problem is in fact
  no harder. Next, we study the extension to the lifelong learning with expert advice
  in which one has to make online predictions with a sequence of tasks. For this problem,
  we provide a single algorithm which works for both adversarial and stochastic setting,
  and our bounds when specialized to the case without branching recover the regret
  bounds previously achieved separately via different algorithms. Furthermore, we
  prove a regret lower bound which shows that in the lifelong learning scenario, the
  case with branching experts now becomes strictly harder than the non-branching case
  in the stochastic setting.'
