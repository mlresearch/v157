title: 'S2TNet: Spatio-Temporal Transformer Networks for Trajectory Prediction in
  Autonomous Driving'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: To safely and rationally participate in dense and heterogeneous traffic,
  autonomous vehicles require to sufficiently analyze the motion patterns of surrounding
  traffic-agents and accurately predict their future trajectories. This is challenging
  because the trajectories of traffic-agents are not only influenced by the traffic-agents
  themselves but also by spatial interaction with each other. Previous methods usually
  rely on the sequential step-by-step processing of Long Short-Term Memory networks
  (LSTMs) and merely extract the interactions between spatial neighbors for single
  type traffic-agents. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Transformer Networks (S2TNet),
  which models the spatio-temporal interactions by spatio-temporal Transformer and
  deals with the temporel sequences by temporal Transformer. We input additional category,
  shape and heading information into our networks to handle the heterogeneity of traffic-agents.
  The proposed methods outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ApolloScape Trajectory
  dataset by more than 7% on both the weighted sum of Average and Final Displacement
  Error.
