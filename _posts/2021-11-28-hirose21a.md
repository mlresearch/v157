  Neural Network Architecture and Training Hyperparameters'

abstract: The benchmark datasets for neural architecture search (NAS) have been developed
  to alleviate the computationally expensive evaluation process and ensure a fair
  comparison. Recent NAS benchmarks only focus on architecture optimization, although
  the training hyperparameters affect the obtained model performances. Building the
  benchmark dataset for joint optimization of architecture and training hyperparameters
  is essential to further NAS research. The existing NAS-HPO-Bench is a benchmark
  for joint optimization, but it does not consider the network connectivity design
  as done in modern NAS algorithms. This paper introduces the first benchmark dataset
  for joint optimization of network connections and training hyperparameters, which
  we call NAS-HPO-Bench-II. We collect the performance data of 4K cell-based convolutional
  neural network architectures trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with different learning
  rate and batch size settings, resulting in the data of 192K configurations. The
  dataset includes the exact data for 12 epoch training. We further build the surrogate
  model predicting the accuracies after 200 epoch training to provide the performance
  data of longer training epoch. By analyzing NAS-HPO-Bench-II, we confirm the dependency
  between architecture and training hyperparameters and the necessity of joint optimization.
  Finally, we demonstrate the benchmarking of the baseline optimization algorithms
  using NAS-HPO-Bench-II.
