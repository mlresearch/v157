title: Encoder-decoder-based image transformation approach for integrating precipitation
  forecasts
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: As the damage caused by heavy rainfall is becoming more serious, the improvement
  of precipitation forecasts is highly demanded. For this purpose, arithmetic and
  Bayesian average-based methods have been proposed to integrate multiple 2D-grid
  forecasts. However, since a single weight is shared in the entire grid in these
  methods, local variations of the importance of forecasts could not be taken into
  account. Besides, although a variety of information is available in precipitation
  forecast, it would not be straightforwardly to incorporate the additional information
  in the existing methods. To overcome these problems, we propose an encoder-decoder-based
  image transformation method that generates a weight image that is optimized in a
  pixel-wise manner and additional information could be embedded as the channel of
  input images and feature maps. Through the experiment of precipitation forecast
  in the period from April 2018 to March 2019 in Japan, we will show that our proposed
  integration method outperforms existing methods.
