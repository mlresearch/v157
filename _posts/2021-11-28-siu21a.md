title: Dynamic Coordination Graph for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'This paper introduces Dynamic $Q$-value Coordination Graph (QCGraph) for
  cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. QCGraph aims to dynamically represent
  and generalize through factorizing the joint value function of all agents according
  to dynamically created coordination graph based on subsets of agents. The value
  can be maximized by message passing at both a local and global level along the graph
  which allows training the value function end-to-end. The coordination graph is dynamically
  generated and used to generate the payoff functions which are approximated using
  graph neural networks and parameter sharing to improve generalization over the state-action
  space. We show that QCGraph can solve a variety of challenging multi-agent tasks
  being superior to other value factorization approaches. '
