title: Convolutional Hypercomplex Embeddings for Link Prediction
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest
  normed division algebras, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest
  that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective
  means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on real-valued
  embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link prediction. In this paper,
  we investigate a composition of convolution operations with hypercomplex multiplications.
  We propose the four approaches QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO  to tackle the link
  prediction problem. QMult and OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion
  extensions of previous state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx.
  ConvQ and ConvO build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in
  a way inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on
  seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10. Experimental
  results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued vector representations
  become more apparent as the size and complexity of the knowledge graph grows. ConvO
  outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while
  QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in
  all metrics. Results also suggest that link prediction performances can be further
  improved via prediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an
  open-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation scripts
  as well as pretrained models.
