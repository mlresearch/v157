title: Bayesian Latent Factor Model for Higher-order Data
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Latent factor models are canonical tools to learn low-dimensional and linear
  embedding of original data. Traditional latent factor models are based on low-rank
  matrix factorization of covariance matrices. However, for higher-order data with
  multiple modes, i.e., tensors, this simple treatment fails to take into account
  the mode-specific relations. This ignorance leads to inefficiency in analysis of
  complex structures as well as poor data compression ability. In this paper, unlike
  covariance matrices, we investigate high-order covariance tensor directly by exploiting
  tensor ring (TR) format and propose the Bayesian TR latent factor model, which can
  represent complex multi-linear correlations and achieves efficient data compression.
  To overcome the difficulty of finding the optimal TR-ranks and simultaneously imposing
  sparsity on loading coefficients, a multiplicative Gamma process (MGP) prior is
  adopted to automatically infer the ranks and obtain sparsity. Then, we establish
  an efficient parameter-expanded EM algorithm to learn the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
  estimate of model parameters. Finally, we evaluate our model on covariance estimation,
  latent factor learning and image inpainting problems.
