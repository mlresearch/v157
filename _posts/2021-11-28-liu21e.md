title: An online semi-definite programming with a generalised log-determinant regularizer
  and its applications
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'We consider a variant of the online semi-definite programming problem:
  The decision space consists of positive semi-definite matrices with bounded diagonal
  entries and bounded $\Gamma$-trace norm, which is a generalization of the trace
  norm defined by a positive definite matrix $\Gamma$. To solve this problem, we propose
  a follow-the-regularized-leader algorithm with a novel regularizer, which is a generalisation
  of the log-determinant function parameterized by the matrix $\Gamma$. Then we apply
  our algorithm to online binary matrix completion (OBMC) with side information and
  online similarity prediction with side information, and improve mistake bounds by
  logarithmic factors. In particular, for OBMC our mistake bound is optimal.'
