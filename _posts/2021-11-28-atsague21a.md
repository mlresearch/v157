title: A Mutual Information Regularization for Adversarial Training
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Recently, a number of  methods have been developed to alleviate the vulnerability
  of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, among which adversarial training
  and its variants have been demonstrated to be the most effective empirically. This
  paper aims to further improve the robustness of adversarial training against adversarial
  examples. We propose a new training method called mutual information and mean absolute
  error adversarial training (MIMAE-AT) in which the mutual information between the
  probabilistic predictions of the natural and the adversarial examples along with
  the mean absolute error between their logits are used as regularization terms to
  the standard adversarial training.We conduct  experiments and demonstrate that the
  proposed MIMAE-AT method improves the state-of-the-art on adversarial robustness.
