title: Generating Deep Networks Explanations with Robust Attribution Alignment
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Attribution methods play a key role in generating post-hoc explanations
  on pre-trained models, however it has been shown that existing methods yield unfaithful
  and noisy explanations. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of attribution
  method: we treat the model’s explanations as a part of network’s outputs then generate
  attribution maps from the underlying deep network. The generated attribution maps
  are up-sampled from the last convolutional layer of the network to obtain localization
  information about the target to be explained. Inspired by recent studies that showed
  adversarially robust models’ saliency map aligns well with human perception, we
  utilize attribution maps from the robust model to supervise the learned attributions.
  Our proposed method can produce visually plausible explanations along with the prediction
  in inference phase. Experiments on real datasets show that our proposed method yields
  more faithful explanations than post-hoc attribution methods with lighter computational
  costs.'
