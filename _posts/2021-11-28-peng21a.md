title: Deep Structural Contrastive Subspace Clustering
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Deep subspace clustering based on data self-expression is devoted to learning
  pairwise affinities in the latent feature space. Existing methods tend to rely on
  an autoencoder framework to learn representations for an affinity matrix. However,
  the representation learning driven largely by pixel-level data reconstruction is
  somewhat incompatible with the subspace clustering task. With the unavailability
  of ground truth, can structural representations, which is exactly what subspace
  clustering favors, be achieved by simply exploiting the supervision information
  in the data itself? In this paper, we formulate this intuition as a structural contrastive
  prediction task and propose an end-to-end trainable framework referred as Deep Structural
  Contrastive Subspace Clustering (DSCSC). Specifically, DSCSC makes use of data augmentation
  technique to mine positive pairs and constructs a data similarity graph in the embedding
  feature space to search negative pairs. A novel structural contrastive loss is proposed
  on the latent representations to achieve positive-concentrated and negative-separated
  property for subspace preserving. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets
  demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering
  methods and imply the necessity of the proposed structural contrastive loss.
