title: Bayesian Inference for Optimal Transport with Stochastic Cost
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'In machine learning and computer vision, optimal transport has had significant
  success inlearning generative models and defining metric distances between structured
  and stochasticdata objects, that can be cast as probability measures.  The key element
  of optimal trans-port is the so called lifting of anexactcost (distance) function,
  defined on the sample space,to a cost (distance) between probability measures over
  the sample space.  However, in manyreal life applications the cost isstochastic:
  e.g., the unpredictable traffic flow affects the costof transportation between a
  factory and an outlet.  To take this stochasticity into account,we introduce a Bayesian
  framework for inferring the optimal transport plan distributioninduced by the stochastic
  cost, allowing for a principled way to include prior informationand to model the
  induced stochasticity on the transport plans.  Additionally, we tailor anHMC method
  to sample from the resulting transport plan posterior distribution.'
