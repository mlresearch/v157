title: Learning Maximum Margin Markov Networks from examples with missing labels
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Structured output classifiers based on the framework of Markov Networks
  provide a transparent way to model statistical dependencies between output labels.
  The Markov Network (MN) classifier can be efficiently learned by the maximum margin
  method, which however requires expensive completely annotated examples. We extend
  the maximum margin algorithm for learning of unrestricted MN classifiers from examples
  with partially missing annotation of labels. The proposed algorithm translates learning
  into minimization of a novel loss function which is convex, has a clear connection
  with the supervised margin-rescaling loss, and can be efficiently optimized by first-order
  methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on a challenging
  structured output classification problem where it beats deep neural network models
  trained from a much higher number of completely annotated examples, while the proposed
  method used only partial annotations.
