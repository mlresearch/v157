title: Robust Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Greenhouse Control
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Due to the high efficiency and less weather dependency, autonomous greenhouses
  provide an ideal solution to meet the increasing demand for fresh food. However,
  managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate control strategies
  for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse control problem is an
  astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent closed-loop control framework is
  highly desired to generate an automatic control policy. As a powerful tool for optimal
  control, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can surpass human beingsâ€™ decision-making
  and can also be seamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However,
  in complex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the
  interaction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the application
  of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample efficiency and safety.
  Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the efficiency problem of greenhouse
  control, the safety problem has not got too much attention. In this paper, we present
  a model-based robust RL framework for autonomous greenhouse control to meet the
  sample efficiency and safety challenges. Specifically, our framework introduces
  an ensemble of environment models to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization,
  thereby addressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern,
  we propose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can
  help improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme cases.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can learn a more effective greenhouse
  planting policy with better robustness than existing methods.
