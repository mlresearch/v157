  from Label Proportions
section: Contributed Papers

abstract: In this paper, we study a task called Learning from Label Proportions (LLP).
  LLP aims to learn an instance-level classifier given a number of bags and each bag
  is composed of several instances. The label of each instance is concealed and what
  we know is the proportion of each class in each bag. The lack of instance-level
  supervision information makes the model struggle for finding the right direction
  for optimization. In this paper, we solve this problem by developing a two-stage
  training framework. First, we facilitate contrastive learning to train a feature
  extractor in an unsupervised way. Second, we train a linear classifier with the
  parameter of the feature extractor fixed. This framework performs much better than
  most baselines but is still unsatisfactory when the bag size or the number of classes
  is large. Therefore, we further propose a Feature-Label Matching mechanism (FLMm).
  FLMm can provide a roughly right optimization direction for the classifier by assigning
  labels to a subset of instances selected in this bag with a high degree of confidence.
  Therefore, the classifier can more easily establish the correspondence between instances
  and labels in the second stage. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets,
  namely CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, show that our model is far superior than baseline models,
  for example, accuracy increases from 43.44% to 61.25% for bag size 128 on CIFAR100.
