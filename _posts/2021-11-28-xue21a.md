title: Physics-inspired Learning for Structure-Aware Texture-Sensitive Underwater
  Image Enhancement
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Recently, improving the visual quality of underwater images using deep learning-based
  methods has drawn considerable attention. Unfortunately, diverse environmental factors
  (e.g., blue/green color distortion) severely limit their performance in real-world
  environments. Therefore, strengthening the superiority of the underwater image enhancement
  method is critical. In this paper, we devote ourselves to develop a new architecture
  with strong superiority and adaptability. Inspired by the underwater imaging principle,
  we establish a novel physics-inspired learning model that is easy to realize. A
  Structure-Aware Texture-Sensitive Network (SATS-Net) is further developed to portray
  the model. The structure-aware module is responsible for structural information,
  and the texture-sensitive module is responsible for textural information. Thus,
  SATS-Net successfully incorporates robust characterization absorbed from the physical
  principle to achieve strong robustness and adaptability. We conduct extensive experiments
  to demonstrate that SATS-Net outperforms existing advanced techniques in various
  real-world underwater environments.
