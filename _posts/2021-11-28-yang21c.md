title: Regularized Mutual Learning for Personalized Federated Learning
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-protected learning paradigm, which
  allows many clients to jointly train a model under the coordination of a server
  without the local data leakage. In real-world scenarios, data in different clients
  usually cannot satisfy the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption
  adopted widely in machine learning. Traditionally training a single global model
  may cause performance degradation and difficulty in ensuring convergence in such
  a non-i.i.d. case.  To handle this case, various models can be trained for each
  client to capture the personalization in each client. In this paper, we propose
  a new personalized FL framework, called Personalized Federated Mutual Learning (PFML),
  to use the non-i.i.d. characteristics to generate specific models for clients. Specifically,
  the PFML method integrates mutual learning into the local update process in each
  client to not only improve the performance of both the global and personalized models
  but also speed up the convergence compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
  the proposed PFML method can help maintain the heterogeneity of client models and
  protect the information of personalized models. Experiments on benchmark datasets
  show the effectiveness of the proposed PFML model. '
