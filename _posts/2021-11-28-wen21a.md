  Learning
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Data imbalance is prevalent in classification problems and tends to bias
  the classifier towards the majority of classes. This paper proposes a decision tree
  building method for imbalanced binary classification via deep reinforcement learning.
  First, the decision tree building process is regarded as a multi-step game and modeled
  as a Markov decision process. Then, the tree-based convolution is applied to extract
  state vectors from the tree structure, and each node is abstracted into a parameterized
  action. Next, the reward function is designed based on a range of evaluation metrics
  of imbalanced classification. Finally, a popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm
  called Multi-Pass DQN is employed to find an optimal decision tree building policy.
  The experiments on more than 15 imbalanced data sets indicate that our method outperforms
  the state-of-the-art methods.
