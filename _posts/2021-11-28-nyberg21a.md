title: Uplift Modeling with High Class Imbalance
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Uplift modeling refers to estimating the causal effect of a treatment on
  an individual observation, used for instance to identify customers worth targeting
  with a discount in e-commerce. We introduce a simple yet effective undersampling
  strategy for dealing with the prevalent problem of high class imbalance (low conversion
  rate) in such applications. Our strategy is agnostic to the base learners and produces
  a 6.5% improvement over the best published benchmark for the largest public uplift
  data which incidentally exhibits high class imbalance. We also introduce a new metric
  on calibration for uplift modeling and present a strategy to improve the calibration
  of the proposed method.
