title: 'DAGSurv: Directed Ayclic Graph Based Survival Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Causal structures for observational survival data provide crucial information
  regarding the relationships between covariates and time-to-event. We derive motivation
  from the information theoretic source coding argument, and show that incorporating
  the knowledge of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be beneficial if suitable
  source encoders are employed. As a possible source encoder in this context, we derive
  a variational inference based conditional variational autoencoder for causal structured
  survival prediction, which we refer to as \texttt{DAGSurv}. We illustrate the performance
  of \texttt{DAGSurv} on low and high-dimensional synthetic datasets, and real-world
  datasets such as METABRIC and GBSG. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
  other survival analysis baselines such as \texttt{Cox} Proportional Hazards, \texttt{DeepSurv}
  and \texttt{Deephit}, which are oblivious to the underlying causal relationship
  between data entities.
