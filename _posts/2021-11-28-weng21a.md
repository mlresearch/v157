title: "$h$-DBSCAN: A simple fast DBSCAN algorithm for big data"
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'DBSCAN is a classical clustering algorithm, which can identify different
  shapes and isolate noisy patterns from a dataset. Despite the above advantages,
  the bottleneck of DBSCAN is its computation time for high dimensional datasets.
  This work, thus, presents a simple and fast method to improve the efficiency of
  DBSCAN algorithm. We reduce the execution time in two aspects. The first one is
  to reduce the number of points presented to DBSCAN and the second one is to apply
  the HNSW technique instead of the linear search structure for improving its efficiency.
  The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can greatly improve the
  clustering speed without losing or even obtaining better accuracy, especially for
  large-scale datasets. '
