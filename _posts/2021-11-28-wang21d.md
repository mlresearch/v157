title: Pyramid Correlation based Deep Hough Voting for Visual Object Tracking
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: " Most of the existing Siamese-based trackers treat tracking problem as
  a parallel task of classification and regression. However, some studies show that
  the sibling head structure could lead to suboptimal solutions during the network
  training. Through experiments we find that, without regression, the performance
  could be equally promising as long as we delicately design the network to suit the
  training objective. We introduce a novel voting-based classification-only tracking
  algorithm named Pyramid Correlation based Deep Hough Voting (short for PCDHV), to
  jointly locate the top-left and bottom-right corners of the target. Specifically
  we innovatively construct a Pyramid Correlation module to equip the embedded feature
  with fine-grained local structures and global spatial contexts; The elaborately
  designed Deep Hough Voting module further take over, integrating long-range dependencies
  of pixels to perceive corners; In addition, the prevalent discretization gap is
  simply yet effectively alleviated by increasing the spatial resolution of the feature
  maps while exploiting channel-space relationships. The algorithm is general, robust
  and simple. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the module through a series of ablation
  experiments. Without bells and whistles, our tracker achieves better or comparable
  performance to the SOTA algorithms on three challenging benchmarks (TrackingNet,
  GOT-10k and LaSOT) while running at a real-time speed of 80 FPS. Codes and models
  will be released. "
