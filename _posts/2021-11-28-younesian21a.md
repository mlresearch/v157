title: 'QActor: Active Learning on Noisy Labels'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Noisy labeled data is more a norm than a rarity for self-generated content
  that is continuously published on the web and social media from non-experts. Active
  querying experts are conventionally adopted to provide labels for the informative
  samples which donâ€™t have labels, instead of possibly incorrect labels. The new challenge
  that arises here is how to discern the informative and noisy labels which benefit
  from expert cleaning.  In this paper, we aim to leverage the stringent oracle budget
  to robustly maximize learning accuracy. We propose a noise-aware active learning
  framework, QActor, and a novel measure \emph{CENT}, which considers both cross-entropy
  and entropy to select informative and noisy labels for an expert cleansing. QActor
  iteratively cleans samples via quality models and actively querying an expert on
  those noisy yet informative samples. To adapt to learning capacity per iteration,
  QActor dynamically adjusts the query limit according to the learning loss for each
  learning iteration. We extensively evaluate different image datasets with noise
  label ratios ranging between 30% and 60%. Our results show that QActor can nearly
  match the optimal accuracy achieved using only clean data at the cost of only an
  additional 10% of ground truth data from the oracle.
