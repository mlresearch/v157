title: 'Geometric Value Iteration: Dynamic Error-Aware KL Regularization for Reinforcement
  Learning'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: " The recent boom in the literature on entropy-regularized reinforcement
  learning (RL) approaches reveals that Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization brings
  advantages to RL algorithms by canceling out errors under mild assumptions. However,
  existing analyses focus on fixed regularization with a constant weighting coefficient
  and do not consider cases where the coefficient is allowed to change dynamically.
  In this paper, we study the dynamic coefficient scheme and present the first asymptotic
  error bound. Based on the dynamic coefficient error bound, we propose an effective
  scheme to tune the coefficient according to the magnitude of error in favor of more
  robust learning. Complementing this development, we propose a novel algorithm, Geometric
  Value Iteration (GVI), that features a dynamic error-aware KL coefficient design
  with the aim of mitigating the impact of errors on performance. Our experiments
  demonstrate that GVI can effectively exploit the trade-off between learning speed
  and robustness over uniform averaging of a constant KL coefficient. The combination
  of GVI and deep networks shows stable learning behavior even in the absence of a
  target network, where algorithms with a constant KL coefficient would greatly oscillate
  or even fail to converge."
