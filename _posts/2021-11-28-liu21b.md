title: 'CTS2: Time Series Smoothing with Constrained Reinforcement Learning'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Time series smoothing is essential for time series analysis and forecasting.
  It helps to identify trends and patterns of time series. However, the presence of
  irregular perturbations disrupt the time series smoothness and distort information.
  The goal of time series smoothing is to remove these perturbations while preserving
  as much information as possible. Existing smoothing algorithms have complete freedom
  to make corrections to the data points which often over smooth the time series and
  lose information. None of them considers constraining data corrections to the best
  of our knowledge. Moreover, most existing methods either do not smooth in real-time
  or their parameters need to be hand-tuned in different scenarios. To improve smoothing
  performance while considering data correction constraints, we propose a $\mathbf{C}$onstrained
  reinforcement learning-based  $\mathbf{T}$ime  $\mathbf{S}$eries  $\mathbf{S}$moothing
  method, or CTS$^2$. Specifically, we first formulate the smoothing problem as a
  Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We then incorporate  data correction
  constraints to restrict the amount of correction at each point. Finally, we learn
  a policy network with a linear projection layer to smooth the time series. The linear
  projection layer ensures that all data corrections satisfy the data correction constraints.
  We evaluate CTS$^2$ on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets; our results
  show that CTS$^2$ successfully smooths time series in real-time, satisfies all the
  correction constraints, and works efficiently in a variety of scenarios.
