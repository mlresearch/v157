title: Lifelong Learning with Sketched Structural Regularization
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Preventing catastrophic forgetting while continually learning new tasks
  is an essential problem in lifelong learning. Structural regularization (SR) refers
  to a family of algorithms that mitigate catastrophic forgetting by penalizing the
  network for changing its “critical parameters" from previous tasks while learning
  a new one. The penalty is often induced via a quadratic regularizer defined by an
  \emph{importance matrix}, e.g., the (empirical) Fisher information matrix in the
  Elastic Weight Consolidation framework. In practice and due to computational constraints,
  most SR methods crudely approximate the importance matrix by its diagonal. In this
  paper, we propose \emph{Sketched Structural Regularization} (Sketched SR) as an
  alternative approach to compress the importance matrices used for regularizing in
  SR methods. Specifically, we apply \emph{linear sketching methods} to better approximate
  the importance matrices in SR algorithms. We show that sketched SR: (i) is computationally
  efficient and straightforward to implement, (ii) provides an approximation error
  that is justified in theory, and (iii) is method oblivious by construction and can
  be adapted to any method that belongs to the SR class. We show that our proposed
  approach consistently improves various SR algorithms’ performance on both synthetic
  experiments and benchmark continual learning tasks, including permuted-MNIST and
  CIFAR-100.'
