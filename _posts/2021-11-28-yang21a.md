abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has made remarkable progress in automatically
  designing neural networks. However, existing differentiable NAS and stochastic NAS
  methods are either biased towards exploitation and thus may converge to a local
  minimum, or biased towards exploration and thus converge slowly. In this work, we
  propose a Dynamic and Differentiable Space-Architecture Search (DDSAS) method to
  address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. DDSAS dynamically samples space, searches
  architectures in the sampled subspace with gradient descent, and leverages the Upper
  Confidence Bound (UCB) to balance exploitation and exploration. The whole search
  space is elastic, offering flexibility to evolve and to consider resource constraints.
  Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate that with only 4GB memory
  and 3 hours for searching, DDSAS achieves 2.39% test error on CIFAR10, 16.26% test
  error on CIFAR100, and 23.9% test error when transferring to ImageNet. When directly
  searching on ImageNet, DDSAS achieves comparable accuracy with more than 6.5 times
  speedup over state-of-the-art methods. The source codes are available at https://github.com/xingxing-123/DDSAS.
