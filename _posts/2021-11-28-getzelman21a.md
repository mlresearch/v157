title: Learning to Switch Optimizers for Quadratic Programming
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: 'Quadratic programming (QP) seeks to solve optimization problems involving
  quadratic functions that can include complex boundary constraints. QP in the unrestricted
  form is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard; but when restricted to the convex case, it becomes
  tractable. Active set and interior point methods are used to solve convex problems,
  and in the nonconvex case various heuristics or relaxations are used to produce
  high-quality solutions in finite time. Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging
  approach to design solvers for optimization problems. We develop an L2O approach
  that uses reinforcement learning to learn a stochastic policy to switch between
  pre-existing optimization algorithms to solve QP problem instances. In particular,
  our agent switches between three simple optimizers: Adam, gradient descent, and
  random search. Our experiments show that the learned optimizer minimizes quadratic
  functions faster and finds better-quality solutions in the long term than do any
  of the possible optimizers switched between. We also compare our solver with the
  standard QP algorithms in MATLAB and find better performance in fewer function evaluations.'
