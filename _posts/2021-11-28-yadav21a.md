title: 'SPDE-Net: Neural Network based prediction of stabilization parameter for SUPG
  technique'
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: We propose \textit{SPDE-Net}, an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict
  the stabilization parameter for the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization
  technique for solving singularly perturbed differential equations (SPDEs). The prediction
  task is modeled as a regression problem and is solved using ANN. Three training
  strategies for the ANN have been proposed i.e supervised, $L^2$ error minimization
  (global) and $L^2$ error minimization (local). It has been observed that the proposed
  method yields accurate results, and even outperforms some of the existing state-of-the-art
  ANN-based partial differential equation (PDE) solvers such as Physics Informed Neural
  Network (PINN).
