title: "$K^2$-GNN: Multiple Users’ Comments Integration with Probabilistic K-Hop Knowledge
  Graph Neural Networks"
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Integrating multiple comments into a concise statement for any online products
  or web services requires a non-trivial understanding of the input. Recently, graph
  neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to learn from highly-structured
  graph representations to mitigate the relationship between entities, such as co-references.
  However, current inter-sentence relation extraction cannot leverage discrete reasoning
  chains over multiple comments. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose
  a probabilistic $K$-hop knowledge graph (KKG) to extend existing knowledge graphs
  with inferred relations via discrete intra-sentence and inter-sentence reasoning
  chains. KKG associates each inferred relation with a confidence value through Bayesian
  inference. We further answer how a knowledge graph with inferred relations can help
  the multiple comments integration through integrating KKG with GNN ($\text{K}^2$-GNN).
  Our extensive experimental results show that our $\text{K}^2$-GNN outperforms all
  baseline graph models on multiple comments integration.
