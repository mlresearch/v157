title: Local Aggressive Adversarial Attacks on 3D Point Cloud
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Deep neural networks are found to be prone to adversarial examples which
  could deliberately fool the model to make mistakes. Recently, a few of works expand
  this task from 2D image to 3D point cloud by using global point cloud optimization.
  However, the perturbations of global point are not effective for misleading the
  victim model. First, not all points are important in optimization toward misleading.
  Abundant points account considerable distortion budget but contribute trivially
  to attack. Second, the multi-label optimization is suboptimal for adversarial attack,
  since it consumes extra energy in finding multi-label victim model collapse and
  causes instance transformation to be dissimilar to any particular instance. Third,
  the independent adversarial and perceptibility losses, caring misclassification
  and dissimilarity separately, treat the updating of each point equally without a
  focus. Therefore, once perceptibility loss approaches its budget threshold, all
  points would be stock in the surface of hypersphere and attack would be locked in
  local optimality. Therefore, we propose a local aggressive adversarial attacks (L3A)
  to solve above issues. Technically, we select a bunch of salient points, the high-score
  subset of point cloud according to gradient, to perturb. Then a flow of aggressive
  optimization strategies are developed to reinforce the unperceptive generation of
  adversarial examples toward misleading victim models. Extensive experiments on PointNet,
  PointNet++ and DGCNN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method
  against existing adversarial attack methods.
