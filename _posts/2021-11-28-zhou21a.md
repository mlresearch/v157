title: Video Action Recognition with Neural Architecture Search
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have been widely used in the
  field of videoaction  recognition.   Current  approaches  tend  to  concentrate  on  the  structure  design  fordifferent
  backbone networks, but what kind of network structures can process video botheffectively
  and quickly still remains to be solved despite the encouraging progress.  With thehelp
  of neural architecture search (NAS), we search for three hyperparameters in the
  videoprocessing network, which are the number of frames, the number of layers per
  residual stageand the channel number for all layers.  We relax the entire search
  space into a continuoussearch  space,  and  search  for  a  set  of  network  architectures  that  balance  accuracy  andcomputational  efficiency  by  considering  accuracy  as  the  primary  optimization  goal  andcomputational
  complexity as the secondary optimization goal.  We conduct experiments onUCF101
  and Kinetics400 datasets, validating new state-of-the-art results of the proposedNAS
  based scheme for video action recognition.
