abstract: 'Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an important and active
  research direction in deep learning. It is worth noting that most of the existing
  GNN-based methods learn graph representations within the Euclidean vector space.
  Beyond the Euclidean space, learning representation and embeddings in hyper-complex
  space have also shown to be a promising and effective approach. To this end, we
  propose Quaternion Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) to learn graph representations within
  the Quaternion space. As demonstrated, the Quaternion space, a hyper-complex vector
  space, provides highly meaningful computations and analogical calculus through Hamilton
  product compared to the Euclidean and complex vector spaces. Our QGNN obtains state-of-the-art
  results on a range of benchmark datasets for graph classification and node classification.
  Besides, regarding knowledge graphs, our QGNN-based embedding model achieves state-of-the-art
  results on three new and challenging benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion.
