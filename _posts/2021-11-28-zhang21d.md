title: Bias-tolerant Fair Classification
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: The label bias and selection bias are acknowledged as two reasons in data
  that will hinder the fairness of machine-learning outcomes. The label bias occurs
  when the labeling decision is disturbed by sensitive features, while the selection
  bias occurs when subjective bias exists during the data sampling. Even worse, models
  trained on such data can inherit or even intensify the discrimination. Most algorithmic
  fairness approaches perform an empirical risk minimization with predefined fairness
  constraints, which tends to trade-off accuracy for fairness. However, such methods
  would achieve the desired fairness level with the sacrifice of the benefits (receive
  positive outcomes) for individuals affected by the bias. Therefore, we propose a
  \textbf{B}ias-Tolerant \textbf{FA}ir \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{L}oss (B-FARL),
  which tries to regain the benefits using data affected by label bias and selection
  bias. B-FARL takes the biased data as input, calls a model that approximates the
  one trained with fair but latent data, and thus prevents discrimination without
  constraints required. In addition, we show the effective components by decomposing
  B-FARL, and we utilize the meta-learning framework for the B-FARL optimization.
  The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method is empirically
  effective in improving fairness towards the direction of true but latent labels.
