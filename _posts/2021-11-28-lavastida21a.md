title: Scaling Average-Linkage via Sparse Cluster Embeddings
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Average-linkage is one of the most popular hierarchical clustering  algorithms.
  It is well known that average-linkage  does not scale to large data sets due to
  the slow asymptotic running time. The fastest known implementation has running time
  quadratic in the number of data points. This paper presents a technique that we
  call cluster embedding.  The embedding maps each cluster into a point in slightly
  higher dimensions. The pairwise distances between the mapped points approximate
  the average distance between clusters. By utilizing this embedding we scale the
  task of finding close pairs of clusters, which is a key step in average-linkage
  clustering. We achieve an approximate, sub-quadratic time implementation of average-linkage.
  We show  theoretically the algorithm proposed in this paper achieves a near-linear
  running time and scales to large data sets.  Moreover, its scalability empirically
  dominates average-linkage and typically offers 3-10x speed-up on large data sets.
