title: Slice-sampling based 3D Object Classification
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: Multiview-based 3D object detection achieved great success in the past years.
  However, for some complex models with complex inner structures, the performances
  of these methods are not satisfactory. This paper provides a method based on slide
  sampling for 3D object classification. First, we slice and sample the model from
  the different depths and directions to get the modelâ€™s features. Then, a deep neural
  network designed based on the attention mechanism is used to classify the input
  data. The experiments show that the performance of our method is competitive on
  ModelNet. Moreover, for some special models with simple surfaces and complex inner
  structures, the performance of our method is outstanding and stable.
