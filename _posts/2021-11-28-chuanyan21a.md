title: Neural Graph Filtering for Context-aware Recommendation
section: Contributed Papers
crossref: acml21
abstract: " With the rapid development of web services, various kinds of context data
  become available in recommender systems to handler the data sparsity problem, called
  context-aware recommendation (CAR). It is challenging to develop effective approaches
  to model and exploit these various and heterogeneous data. Recently, heterogeneous
  information network (HIN) has been adopted to model the context data due to its
  flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity. However, most of the HIN-based methods,
  which rely on meta paths or graph embedding to extract features from HINs, cannot
  fully mine the network structure and semantic features of users and items. Besides,
  these methods, utilizing the global dataset to learn personalized latent factors,
  usually suffer individuality loss problem. In this paper, we propose a neural graph
  filtering method for context-aware recommendation, called NGF. First, we use an
  unified HIN to model both the users’ feedback information and the context data.
  Then, we adopt graph filtering to predict aspect-level ratings on a series of independent
  subgraphs of the unified HIN and feed a deep neural network (DNN) to fuse the predictions
  for CAR. Concretely, graph filtering is a case-by-case algorithm for personalized
  recommendation on HINs, which predicts the further behavior by all its similar historical
  behaviors. We split the unified HIN into many single-aspect networks according to
  the semantic relations and utilize graph filtering to predict user’s behavior on
  each subgraphs. The following deep neural network is to fuse the personalized predictions
  in aspect-level. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our neural graph filtering for CAR."
